# Scripts

Small set of scripts that help save time or repeat tasks.

* `git_author_rewrite`: rewrite the author tag on git commits when they've been checked in under the wrong ID
* `file_encrypt`: encrypt a directory full of files using GPG symmetrical encryption, backing up the original data in case needed
